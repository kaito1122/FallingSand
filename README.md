# FallingSand
This is my high school final project of a Falling Sand game.

By clicking, it either makes the selected block appear or erase. 

It has 10 elements, which each does different functions.

1. Empty ... erases any blocks on the clicked section
2. Metal ... solid block, tolerant on gravity, lava
3. Sand ... falls vertically for gravity
4. Water ... falls for gravity, but just like the real water, it spreads out
5. Fire ... burns the selected block with a few exceptions. depends on the block, it could spread upward
6. Cloud ... rains water and disappear in a few seconds
7. Freeze ... freezes the water that touches this block
8. Fungus ... infects sand, spreads downward, and spawns spore randomly around them
9. Lava ... moves like water, but it burns the thing touches. when touches water, becomes metal
10. Spore ... falls while wavering, infects sand when touches, and disappears randomly
